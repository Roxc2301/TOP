# CV Builder

This is a simple CV builder project for basic Curriculums where you can edit the font, display the font on different ways and more.
## To start the project use
```yarn```

## React-to-pdf

Decided to use this feature to be able to download the component CvElement.jsx so the user can have a copy of this CV.
